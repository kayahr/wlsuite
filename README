A shared library and a suite of programs for converting wasteland files into
standard files and vice versa.

Up to now it implements the following functionality:

  Shared library (libwasteland):
    
    * Bit-wise reading/writing of files
    * Encoding/Decoding data with vertical xor scheme
    * Reading/Writing huffman encoded data
    * Reading/Writing title picture (TITLE.PIC)
    * Reading/Writing sprites (IC0_9.WLF/MASKS.WLF)
    * Reading/Writing tilesets (ALLHTDS1/ALLHTDS2)
    * Reading/Writing mouse cursors (CURS)
    * Reading/Writing fonts (COLORF.FNT)
    * Reading/Writing end animation (END.CPA)
    * Reading encounter animations (ALLPICS1 and ALLPICS2)

  Tools:
  
    * wl_decodecpa: Decodes CPA animation file into an animated GIF image
    * wl_decodehuffman: Huffman-decodes data from STDIN and writes it to STDOUT
    * wl_decodepic: Converts a wasteland PIC image file into a PNG image file
    * wl_encodehuffman: Huffman-encodes data from STDIN and writes it to STDOUT
    * wl_encodepic: Converts a PNG image file into a PIC image file
    * wl_packcpa: Packs PNG files into CPA animation
    * wl_packcursors: Packs PNG files into cursors
    * wl_packfont: Packs PNG files into font
    * wl_packsprites: Packs PNG files into sprites
    * wl_unpackcpa: Unpacks CPA animation file into PNG images
    * wl_unpackcursors: Unpacks cursors into PNG images
    * wl_unpackfont: Unpacks font into PNG images
    * wl_unpackpics: Unpacks animated pictures into PNG images
    * wl_unpacksprites: Unpacks sprites into PNG images
    * wl_unpacktiles: Unpacks the tiles into PNG images
    
Currently missing is support for decoding the files GAME1 and GAME2 and
totally unsupported is the file TRANSTBL (because up to now nobody knows
what this file does)

Write support for encounter animations, map tiles and game files is
technically possible but currently not supported because it makes no sense.
These files are compressed and changing the files most likely results in
smaller or larger files which can then not be used with the game without
modifying the EXE file, too.
